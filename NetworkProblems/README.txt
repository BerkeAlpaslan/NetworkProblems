This project contains a web-based tutorial that explains 10 common network problems through the OSI model. Each problem includes visuals, explanations, and Cisco Packet Tracer simulations to demonstrate both the faulty and corrected network states.

Important Notice About Packet Tracer Files:
The Cisco Packet Tracer simulation files (.pkt) cannot be opened directly via the buttons under the screenshots on each problem page, because modern web browsers do not recognize the .pkt extension as directly executable.

Even though the .pkt files are already included in the project folder on your local machine, clicking the buttons will still trigger a "Download" action.

To view the simulations:
Click the download button under the relevant screenshot.
After the file is downloaded, open it manually using the Cisco Packet Tracer application.


!!!If you experience any issues downloading the .pkt files via the buttons, you can also navigate manually through the project folders. Each problem's simulation files are located in:
./210316016_BERKE_ALPASLAN_NetWork_FDP-250620/problems/problemX/tracers
From there, you can open the .pkt files directly using Cisco Packet Tracer!!!


How to Navigate the Project:
Open the index.html file to launch the homepage.
From the homepage, you can browse each problem by clicking on its card.
Each problem page contains:
A detailed explanation
Screenshots of the issue and solutions
Buttons to download the related .pkt simulation files
